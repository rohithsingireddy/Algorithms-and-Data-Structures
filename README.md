# Algorithms and Data-Structures
<!-- Add Urls to algorithms and book page references -->
Some algorithms I implemmented while studying, well, algorithms.

The cpp implementations might leave some dangling pointers in some programs.

Most of the algorithms are implemented by following the pseudo code present in the book `Introduction to Algorithms` by **CLRS** and from `CP-algorithms` with occasional help from `Stack Overflow`.

Algorithms are tested for small to medium random inputs so edge cases might not have been handled well.
